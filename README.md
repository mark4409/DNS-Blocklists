# DNS Blocklists

DNS Blocklists for the use of blocking web proxys and free vpn websites

At the moment, I'm concentrating on 2 areas: Piracy and Bypass Methods. 

Combined blocklists can be found in the main directory and the individual sub-category listings can be found within the categories folder. 

The lists do not include www prefixes and are therefore most effective with software that is capable of wildcarding all subdomains
